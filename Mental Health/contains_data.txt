My name is Leila. I am 38 years old. I came to Canada last year. I am divorced and lost my job. I have three kids to take care of. Due to the pressure of finding a job and high cost of living, I am in an immense need of visiting a therapist. However, I can't afford a therapist. Here is my phone number: 514-786-6754
The last digits of my social insurance number are: 8448
Thank you.

I'm Alex. I am addicted and suffering from depression. No one has helped me. I feel I'm dying. My number is 612-785-3456
